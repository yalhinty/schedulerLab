/*
1) figure out how to count runtime
	In the procstruct we're creating the time w/ min and max. Divide by number of processes 

2) how to set runtime to minimum rt when process wakes up (left most node?) Do we have to create a tree everytime? Or move one of the nodes everytime?
	Just pick the one with the smallest vruntime

3) what's a channel?
	int. 
	
6) do we automate the process switching or does it do it only when the scheduler is running
	 When it's called
